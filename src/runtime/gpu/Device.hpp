// D3D12 plumbing for the proxy. ONE shared D3D12 device + render queue back the whole stack.
// The engine makes several D3D9 devices; the FIRST (the active/presented one) runs On12 on the shared
// queue, so the side-renderer renders on that same queue and the unwrap/return path stays single-queue.
// Later devices get a throwaway separate queue (a second On12 device sharing the same queue null-derefs
// inside d3d9on12).
