// DB2 (WDC1 / WDC2 / WDC3) decoder. Reads a .db2 file and normalises every record into a
// flat array of 4-byte columns. Implements the field storage model:
//   - storage type 0 (none):                   field bytes are inline in the record.
//   - storage type 1 (bitpacked):              field is a bitfield in the record.
//   - storage type 2 (common data):            field is a default value, overridden per-id in common_data.
//   - storage type 3 (bitpacked indexed):      field is a bitpacked index into pallet_data.
//   - storage type 4 (bitpacked indexed array):field is one index that expands to an array in pallet_data.
// It also resolves the id list / inline id, copy table (duplicated rows), relationship map (appended as a
// trailing column) and multiple sections.
//
// Each field keeps its native width (a uint16 stays 2 bytes, a uint8 stays 1 byte, an array stays
// consecutive elements), laid out with natural C alignment so a Definition row struct matches the decoded
// record. Strings stay as offsets into the reconstructed string table (see DB2File::Str).
