// HOST-only. M2 structural translator: de-chunk the modern container and emit a target-shaped model.
// Pure bytes -> bytes. Only the structural rewrites that are independent of the live engine run here
// (de-chunk; compact cameras/particles/ribbons onto the Client strides; mask sequence blend time;
// remap sequence ids). The material/skin contract rebuild depends on the engine's parsed, pointer-fixed
// skin object and stays in the DLL runtime.
//
// Free functions, span-based, concrete. Data-gated: keyed off the container magic and the inner-version
// RANGE, never an external version flag. See structure/WMO for the worked contract pattern.
